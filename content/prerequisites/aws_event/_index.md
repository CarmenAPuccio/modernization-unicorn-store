# Running the workshop at an AWS Event

This workshop's instructions are currently written to use at an AWS hosted event (such as re:Invent, re:Inforce, Immersion Day or any other event hosted by an AWS employee). The instructions are geared towards using the AWS Workshop Portal which pre-provisions the resources needed to complete the workshop. This will change in the very near future.
